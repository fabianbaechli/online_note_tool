# Design

Decide what design paradigm to choose.

- Material Design
- Weird mixture between Leonards website and material design
- Something ugly

# Abstract

- Nested lists?
  - Tree-like?
    - Every note has a parent note
  - Fixed-depth?
- What does a note contain?
  - Creation date
  - Last modified
  - List of contributors
    - Four different levels of permissions
      - None
      - Reviewer
      - Contributor
      - Owner
  - Content
    - UTF-8 Text
    - Not encrypted

# Main screen

  - ![](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/porting-ios-win8-advanced-figure3.jpg)
- Content view on the right
- Split based system
  - Write dedicated code to make sure this grid-stuff works flawlessly and without clutter
  - Creating a new split and extracting data from it should be very easy
    - Event-based system
